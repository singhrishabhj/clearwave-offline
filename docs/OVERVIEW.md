# Project Overview

## Problem Statement
Many audio recordings contain background noise such as hiss, hum, or
low-volume disturbances. These noises reduce clarity and listening
quality.

The goal of this project is to understand how such noise can be reduced
using simple and understandable techniques in Java.

---

## Input & Output
- **Input:** WAV audio file containing noise
- **Output:** New WAV audio file with reduced background noise

The original file is never modified.

---

## Non-Goals
This project does NOT aim to:
- Process audio in real time
- Capture microphone or system audio
- Use AI or machine learning
- Support multiple audio formats

Keeping the scope small makes the project easier to learn and test.

## Future Scope
This project is the foundation for more advanced systems:
- Streaming audio processing
- Real-time microphone input
- System audio (YouTube, calls)
- Advanced DSP and AI-based noise reduction
