# ClearWave-Offline

ClearWave-Offline is a beginner-friendly Java project that performs
basic noise reduction on an audio file (WAV format).

This project focuses on understanding audio processing fundamentals,
clean object-oriented design, and testable Java code — without dealing
with real-time or OS-level complexities.

---

## What
ClearWave-Offline reads a WAV audio file, processes the audio samples
to reduce background noise, and writes a cleaned WAV file as output.

---

## Why
Real-time audio processing is complex and depends on operating system
and hardware behavior. For learning purposes, offline processing is
much simpler and more predictable.

This project allows us to:
- Focus on Java and OOPS fundamentals
- Understand how audio data is processed
- Design clean, testable code
- Build confidence before moving to real-time systems

---

## How
At a high level, the program works as follows:

1. Read the input WAV file
2. Convert audio data into numerical samples
3. Apply noise reduction logic on samples
4. Write the processed samples back to a WAV file

## Skills Covered
- Java (core)
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Maven project structure
- File handling
- Basic Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
- Test-oriented thinking (SDET mindset)
